Recently, I was asked this question `Do I think if PM is a stressful job?` from another younger PM. Well, I didn't do other roles except for paid marketing so I probably couldn't answer the question systematically.

With what I'm experiencing now, I think the job itself is not stressful. However, as a human, we have different emotions, different reactions to situations that can make the any job stressful.

### Execution is a monster.
In a nutshell, PM's baby is usually a feature/product. At more junior level, when PM has to be heavily involved in running execution (some call it project management), we easily get panic when a feature is messed up (not built according to specs because of some lame miscommunications) or deadline is coming but the code hasn't passed testing yet. When it comes to execution, there are tons of reasons why a feature could go wrong.

Am I stressed when it comes to execution? I think I have experienced quite a bit that I don't easily get panic. But I still get my heart beating fast when I know the feature cannot deploy properly due to things that are within my control. I learn to be patient with myself, engage with my team mates frequently and avoid mistakes as early as I can. Importantly, say sorry when the mistake is yours. When shit happens, the company/stakeholder(s) bear(s) consequence, and saying `Sorry` and sharing next steps are the least thing I can do.

### Stakeholder management is exhausting.
One of the values that PM brings is stakeholder management. Because we pride ourself that we are a decision maker, stakeholders look at us when they have conflicts, are unsure about a decision, or simply don't want to take responsibilities. PM standing between these stakeholders is such a delicate task. I really learn stakeholder management a hard way. And I guess unfortunately, there are so many types of people out there, it probably takes a lifetime to learn how to deal with everyone well. It is stressful (to certain extent) when we are expected to say something in the middle of conflicts. Should we just say "We will get back to you guys?" or fight for your opinion till the end. Whatever scenario we choose, we either have to pay by time (longer meeting) or relationship (someone will get offended).

I think a good PM with exceptional communications requires (1) 200% dedication in a project, (2) clear thinking when every stakeholder talks in their own language with their own agenda and more than anything, (3) stakeholders' trust. Being entrusted by other people, I learn, is the express ticket to decision and dissolve a conflict. For (1) and (2), we can learn quickly and by experience. For (3), I think it's harder. To gain trust, it really requires courage to be aware, to fail and stand up, and to genuinely build relationship with others.

I'm still learning to be better everyday. Right now, I identify my weakness is that I have low tolerance for long-winded / off-focus conversation and unfamiliar accent. Example, I talked a stakeholder coming from Britain. Because of his fluency (in terms of vocabulary), he illustrated his point using flamboyant language and people in the room ended up losing attention. I am not sure what is the best way to deal with these type of people.

### Feature doesn't perform as expected
The feature we've been working hard is out but now, it doesn't show any improvement. Worse, people complain about bugs. Too bad. I do have the guilty feeling because I feel like I wasted my team's effort. But it is what it is. Instead of worrying, I usually spend time digging what could be go wrong and what could be a quick hack to turn the situation around. I said quick hack, because after months working on a project that doesn't show value, trust has been tainted. No one in a right mind would agree to go for another months-long project, hence quick hack.

### Conclusion
All of the points I shared above are really part and parcel of any job. I can easily replace `feature` by another word then it sounds like I'm talking about another job. Stress is a reaction to an incident. Keep asking ourselves what is the incident, what's wrong with that incident and what can we do to make it better now.
