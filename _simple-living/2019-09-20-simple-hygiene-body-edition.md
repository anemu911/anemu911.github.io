`Simple Hygiene` is using not only about eco-friendly products (e.g. less packaging waste, natural content) but also about products whose ingredients are safe for health.

### Motivation
This is a breakdown article of hygiene-related products that I use for my body

### Menstrual Cup
I have to start this article with this product. If there is one thing that makes my life `simple`, it's menstrual cup.
- Current menstrual cup: [Lunette](https://www.lunette.com/)
- Cost: SGD 50
- Experience: It completely changes my experience with period. With menstrual cup, my life moves on as if I'm not having period.1 menstrual cup can last up to 10 years. That's a lot of money and trouble worth saving. It's that awesome!
- Pros: No more throwing pads, no more changing pads every 4 hours, no more leaking, much more hygienic. And it's much cheaper in the long run
- Cons: Learning curve at the beginning (for about 2 cycles)
- Before switching to menstrual cup, I considered this option and cloth pads but time doing laundry for cloth pads really puts me off. And it's not even cleaner.


### Handmade soap
Soap bar is the well-known/popular eco-friendly products. I don't super love this option because it's not super convenient yet much more expensive that normal shower gel while the pros are not super awesome
- Handmade soap (that I've been using): [Soft Cream Soap](https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/shop/SoftCreamStore?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=195324246), [Natural Handmade Soap](https://www.arbims.com/100g__natural_soap-list.aspx)
- Cost: SGD 4-9/bar
- I happened to know about these shops while travelling in Thailand (Bangkok and Chiang Mai). And the links above are actually their online store.
- Handmade soap is (much) more costly than the commercial shower bottle. 1 soap can be used for 1 month. The only reason why I'm experimenting it so far is because it's natural. Whether it's real or just my imagination, I don't feel my skin dry after rinsing it out with water.
- Cons: The only thing I donâ€™t like about soap is I have to either use a loofah or hold it very delicately to lather it on my body. Worse, when the soap is as thin as paper, I am stuck with either (1) making it thinner and I will suffer in my next shower, or (2) finishing it in one goal. There are options like `Soap saver pouch` that can hold your soap and help lather. I found one [here](https://www.amazon.sg/Niome-Handmade-Exfoliating-Cleaning-Scrubber/dp/B07L11JHWM/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=soap+saver+pouch&qid=1571534631&s=gateway&sr=8-2) but yet to try. I will give it a try and update the result here.


### Loofah - Stop using
Loofah is to help lather the soap better while using soap bar. However, I have issues keeping it clean because of the time and effort. Everyday or every week, I have to `wash` to prevent bacteria from breeding. The task itself is small effort but I don't like the idea of having small admin tasks here and there. There are times I will surely forget.
- Current loafah soap: [Soft Cream Soap](https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/listing/664058439/ducky-loofah-sponge?ref=shop_home_active_6)
- Cost: SGD 3
- As mentioned in the homemade soap, I might switch to `Soap saver pouch` that can help both hold and help lather. Let's see if it's a better alternative.
