`Simple Hygiene` is using not only about eco-friendly products (e.g. less packaging waste, natural content) but also about products whose ingredients are safe for health.

### Motivation

This is a breakdown article of hygiene-related products that I use for my hair

#### Oil, oil and oil: Coconut Oil, Argan Oil
Seriously oil really saves my hair because I suffered from dry and dull hair for the longest time.

Coconut oil: As hair mask
- Current coconut oil: [Simple Mill Farms Raw Virgin Organic Cold Pressed Coconut Oil](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/searchterm/coconut%20oil)
- Cost: SGD 11.8 for 500ml. This is cheaper than my previous option ([Artnaturals - Argan Oil Hair Mask](https://sg.iherb.com/pr/Artnaturals-Argan-Oil-Hair-Mask-8-oz-226-g/77745) - ~ SGD 20 for 250g)
- How to use: Scoop out 1 tablespoon and wait for it to soften. Take a bit onto hand, warm it up and massage onto hair gently. After that, I have to wait for 30 mins - 1 hour, then do wash `dry` (by simply adding shampoo and wait for additional 15 mins). This is to break down the coconut oil in my hair before washing it with water.
- Frequency: Once a week
- Pros: This really helps moisturise my hair
- Cons: This routine takes time so for weeks that I don't have time, I will skip this step.

Argan oil: As leave-in conditioner
- Current option: [The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Moroccan Argan Oil](https://hush.sg/products/the-ordinary/100-organic-cold-pressed-moroccan-argan-oil)
- Cost: SGD 15 (including delivery fee) for 30ml. This is not really cheaper alternative compared to commercial conditioners. However, every I use, it's just 3 drops for 1 usage so 30ml really goes a long way. I've been using it for months.
- Frequency: Every day
- How to use: Just squeeze 3 drops onto hand, warm it up and run through hair, especially the end where it needs moisture the most.

Other oil I use for face: jojoba oil. More [here](/2019-07-28-simple-hygiene-face-edition)

### Shampoo
Shampoo is the only option that I haven't switched to a natural alternative because my hair is very particular about I put on.
- Current shampoo: [Moist Diane Botanical Shampoo](https://www.watsons.com.sg/botanical-9-herbs-shampoo-480ml/p/BP_62595)
- Cost: SGD 17 for 480ml (really not bad)
- Pros: This shampoo contains no harsh chemicals (e.g. silicones, sulfates, parabens and articial colorants) that are usually found in other products, so it's safe for fine hair like mine.
- Cons: The packaging is plastic and needs to throw away after usage.

### Hair spray (for hair growth) / Scalp refresher
Pomelo/Citrus essential is beneficial for hair growth (in terms of length and more hair).
- Current hair spray: Some brand that my mom bought in Vietnam (natural ingredients). But I will need to make a new one following the instruction from [this blog](http://dreawood.com/2015/02/essential-oil-hair-growth-spray/)
- Cost: Pomoelo essential oil - SGD 10.5 (bought in Vietnam). I will need to DIY to make it into a scalp refresher.
- Frequency: Everyday
- How to use: Just spray directly onto the scalp and massage. I usually use it with argan oil
