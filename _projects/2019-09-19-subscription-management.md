### Motivation
I realised I was multitasking a lot at work. Maybe more than what I expected. I was multitasking between tabs, deep work and meeting, deep work and chat (work and non-work related). Basically, a lot of activities are happening and things are not getting done, fully. Hence, I want to track how distracted I get in terms of number of websites I visited and how long I spent in each website

### Approach
There are already existing solutions out there like https://timelyapp.com/b and https://toggl.com/ that help track time spent online. The solutions are quite solid and widely used, in my opinion. But they are designed to track the hourly-pay working model. Also, the assumption here is user works on 1 task (and 1 task only) in a period of time.

However, my use case is to track my browsing activities a more micro level, more towards how many minutes do I spend on this task before conveniently switching to another tab. Also, I want to learn how to create extension from scratch.

### Solution
Scope wise, I limit to online browser activities in my prototype
