### Background
For the past 5 years, I have been a frequent student to a Yoga centre in Singapore. The point of this article is to share some interesting discovery about yoga classes in the centre by looking at their class schedule over 1.5 months (1 Dec 2020–15 Jan 2021). Note that this Yoga centre has many studios.
The class schedule together with public booking data is able to tell us:
1. No. of classes per day
2. Most popular yoga class types
3. Most popular class time/day of week
4. Studio vs Online classes
5. Teachers: Highest no. of class taught
6. Studio: % Mats filled for popular teachers
7. Online: % Mats filled for popular teachers
8. Studio empty hours

_Disclaimer_: The insights are specific to this yoga centre and should be taken as relative "truth" because behind the scene, it's constrained by studio capacity and teacher capacity which I don't have access to. With that, let's dive in.

### Let's dive in

#### No. of classes per day

For the period of 1.5 months, there were 2.8k classes, which is equivalent to 62 classes per day. Of course, this number doesn't tell us whether it's high or low as there's no comparison basis. 

* If 62 classes/day is higher than usual, maybe it's because a class can only cater to 12 students (due to Covid-19), instead of 24 last time, hence, the studio needs to increase more classes to cover for the loss.
* If 62 classes/day is lower than usual, that could also be they need to stagger rooms usage to minimise interaction among students. Or the room now is used for other high-margin activities (e.g. teacher training). 

My bet is more on the second point where 62 classes/day is lower than usual because I believe the studio is default maximised. 

#### Most popular yoga class types

More than 50% of classes are **Power Flow, Basics and Hot Basics**. It's coincident (or not) because these are the top 3 classes I usually go to. It shows the centre's target audience: beginner - immediate students (like me). Next in the line is **Core, Hot Core and Power** that take up 29.6% of total classes. These top classes are all studio classes. Again, do take into constraints like online classes are "unlimited" mats so they do not need so many online classes.

With specific to online classes, they take up about 10% of total classes. But within online realm, **Power Flow, Basics, Core and Flow&Zen** (in that order) are top class types (80% of total online classes). 

Looking at the class type number (which is not shared here), class distribution in online classes are more even than studio ones (Studio has a lot of long tail / funky classes). The strategy seems to be: running experiment classes in studio and online classes only run `confirmed` popular classes.

#### Most popular class time/date

As a frequent student, I usually thought weekend is the most crowded time but I couldn't be more wrong. Popular class time is defined by the number of mats (not classes) offered during that time (regardless of online or studio). 
Timing wise, top 3 timings are **12:30–13:30, 17:30–18:30 and 10:00–11:00**. I'm not surprised about the 12:30–13:30 as I presume it's lunch time. I guess the 17:30–18:30 caters to crowd who starts work at 8:30 or before that. For 10:00–11:00, I'm not sure who would be the target audience and surprisingly, for this slot, the mats filled are 95.27% (compared to other 2 whose mats filled is around 77%). Who could they be?

Then how about date of the week? **Monday till Thursday** seems to be the most popular timing while the number of classes decrease from Friday and over the weekend. Again, take it with a pinch of salt given the studio location, it is to cater to work crowds rather than resident crowds. For myself, I usually go weekend and maybe I feel it's packed because it has fewer classes to choose from.

#### Studio vs Online classes

This is a fun one. Aside from the significant volume of studio classes compared to online cousin, there are 2 insights worth highlighting:

* Online classes provide capacity of 24 mats/class, compared to studio classes which are more stringent with 10–15 mats depending on locations. However, online classes can only fill up to 12 mats/class whereas studio classes easily max their capacity (80% - 90% in average). So all in all, either online or studio, they actually serve the same number of students.
* In terms of teacher allocation, though online only took 10% of total classes, 40% of teachers are allocated to these classes (on top of studio classes). I'm curious what teacher allocation strategy the centre applies to online classes.

#### Teachers: Highest no. of class taught

During the analysis period, there was 1 teacher that taught 116 classes in the 1.5 month period, meaning 2 classes/day. Kudos to the teacher!

#### Studio: % Mats filled for popular teachers

Among teachers who taught 80 classes and above, the highest % mats filled for 1 teacher is 90%, but other teachers' % mats filled are actually not much lower. The lowest % mats filled is 80%. I guess regardless of teacher, studio classes are doing pretty well.

#### Online: % Mats filled for popular teachers

Online classes tell a different story. The difference in attendance across teachers is much more obvious. A popular teacher can have 80% mats filled while a "not-so-popular" one hits 29% mats filled with a comparable amount of classes. 

#### Studio empty hours

Though weekday has more classes/day than weekend, studio turns out to have more empty hours in weekday more than weekend. Empty hour refers to the opportunity of having at least 1 studio class during the "empty slots". Interesting findings:

* Studio's operation hours in weekend are about 10 hours - 4 hours shorter than weekday (28% shorter).
* Weekend only has 12% fewer classes compared to weekday (9.4 classes/weekday vs 8.2 classes/weekend).

Studio has average of 4 hours empty on weekday and 2 hours in weekend. 

#### Wild guess on revenue

Now I know the no. of classes/day (62), the no. of mats filled/class (12), the cost per mat ($18), the centre's annual revenue could be around:

`62 classes x 12 mats x $18 x 365 = $4.8m`

### Conclusion
So what does it mean? If I'm a studio owner, this could help me look into optimise my studio calendar better. The more I dissect this data in different manners, the more I realise creating a yoga calendar for multiple studios is an art of balancing between student demand, studio constraint and teacher supply.
