`Simple Hygiene` is using not only about eco-friendly products but also about products whose ingredients are safe for health.

### Motivation

This is a breakdown article of hygiene-related products that I use

### Menstrual Cup
I have to start this article with this product. If there is one thing that makes my life `simple`, it's menstrual cup.
- Current menstrual cup: [Lunette](https://www.lunette.com/)
- Experience: It completely changes my experience with period. It took a bit of learning curve but the paid off has been awesome: hygiene, no more worry about changing pads midway (because this can hold up to 12 hours). The most important, no more throwing pads.
- Before switching to menstrual cup, I considered this option and cloth pads but time doing laundry for cloth pads really puts me off. And it's not even cleaner.

#### Oil, oil and oil: Coconut Oil, Argan Oil, Jojoba oil
Oil in generally a perfect / cheaper / eco-friendly alternative to a lot of beauty products. It's also easy to carry around because it's always in the small bottle. I'm currently using different types of oil for multi-purposes:

- Coconut oil:
(1) As hair mask. Use directly on hair.
(2) Failed attempt: I experimented coconut oil as toothpaste but in warm weather like Singapore, the liquid texture doesn't give a `clean feeling` while brushing.
- Argan oil: As leave-in conditioner. Use directly on hair
- Jojoba oil: As face moisturiser. Like any oil, I just drop few drops onto my hair, warm them up and apply to my face. It wont be oily as it's very light

### Facial Cleanser
I'm fed up of going out and buying a facial cleanser for ~$15 and regret after that. My skin somehow always feels super dry and tight after washing. Like any other beauty products, it uses plastic packaging and harmful for the environment. So double the hate.
- Current option: Oatmeal facial cleanser. It is what it is: just oatmeal
- How to use: Soak oatmeal with water (I usually do it in a small cup) and apply onto my face
- It will be a bit messy to wash out but I enjoy the process of doing it. I usually cleanse my face while showering so the mess doesn't bother me much.


### Shampoo
Shampoo is the only option that I haven't switched to a natural alternative because my hair is very particular about I put on.
- Current shampoo: [Moist Diane Botanical Shampoo](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/moist-diane-botanical-moist-shampoo-480ml-13093749)
- This shampoo contains no harsh chemicals (e.g. silicones, sulfates, parabens and articial colorants) that are usually found in other products, so it's safe for fine hair like mine.

### Natural Toothpaste
- Current toothpaste: [Pearlie White Whitening Toothpaste](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/searchterm/pearl%20toothpaste)
- How to use: This product doesn’t produce as much foam as a normal toothpaste does so the toothbrush doesn’t slide across my teeth easily. That makes me put more effort in brushing and wonder whether my teeth are clean (for the first few times). Another thing to get used to is the texture. It’s a translucent soft-clay like texture and get melted instantly the moment I try to brush.
- Price: $9. It's a bit costly compared to other option
- It's not a super eco-friendly option as the packaging is still plastic


### Handmade soap
- Current handmade soap: [Soft Cream Soap](https://www.etsy.com/sg-en/shop/SoftCreamStore?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=195324246)
- I happened to find about this shop while travelling in Thailand. And the link is actually their online store.
- Handmade soap is (much) more costly than the commercial shower bottle. 1 soap can be used for 1 month. I love it because it's natural so I don't feel dry after rinsing it out with water
- Cons: The only thing I don’t like about soap is I have to either use a loofah or hold it very delicately to lather it on my body. Worse, when the soap is as thin as a paper, I am stuck with either (1) making it thinner and I will suffer in my next shower, or (2) finishing it in one goal. I wish there is a product that helps hold the soap while lathering it. That would make handmade soap a great alternative to shower gel.
