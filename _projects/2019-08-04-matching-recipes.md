### Motivation
I'm not a big fan of cooking but I usually cook once or twice a week for me and my boyfriend. I always end up with leftover ingredients and forget about them. The next time I open the fridge and want to cook, those ingredients have turned bad and unusable. At the same time, the list of recipes I have in my mind are so limited that to reuse the same ingredients, I either eat the same thing or take a lot of effort in researching online.

### Approach
To increase my recipe options and get a consolidated list of ingredients, I crawled from different websites of my favourite Youtubers. Most of their recipe page have 3 sections: (1) Recipe name (2) Ingredients and (3) Instructions. For this project, I don't really need the (3) Instructions. (1) Recipe and (2) Ingredients (name, amount and unit) are enough.

_Phase 1_: Reusable ingredients for 2 recipes. The matching logic is pretty simple. (1) Choose a protein source, (2) Generate list of available recipes that match and select 1, (3) Choose 1 or more reusable ingredients from recipe 1, (4) Generate list of available recipes that match these ingredients.

_Phase 2_: To be updated

### Phase 1: Setup Details (1 week, mostly working over the weekend)
#### Logic testing:
Since the matching logic is pretty simple, I set up a Google Sheet and run the logic using formula. Here is the [Google Sheet]("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CzZqHVZELZlCeCl2wBHwcSyZhGb-BVqI80XgOjIfeAo/edit?usp=sharing")

#### MVP app:
I created a website using the logic I tested into an app. I've been using [Bubble.io]("https://bubble.io/") for these apps because it can hold data and produce actual user experience, which is super awesome. Anyway, here is the demo app.
