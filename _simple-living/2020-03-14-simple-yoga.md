One of my goals for 2020 is to do more yoga, 4 times a week, which is like 4 times more than what I did last year.

### Why yoga
Because I don't like the sweatiness in gym, the interaction with equipments, the loneliness.
Because I don't like running in the park (though I love walking in the park). I got itchiness in my thighs after few minutes.

With yoga, I felt like I could ease into it. There are variations of poses I could choose depending on my level, my mood on that day. I don't really categorise yoga as a sport but it does help stretch and strengthen my body to certain extent.

### How I schedule yoga 4 times a week
Truth to be told, to suddenly change from 1 time to 4 times is not easy. As much as I like doing yoga, getting ready for it is the hard part. Every week, I manage to do at least 2 times. Most of the week I do 3 times, and few exceptional weeks, I cross 4 times. This is how I schedule yoga 4 times a week, 200+ times a year.

#### Getting ready
*Money motivates me:*
I've been a member of [Yoga Movement](https://www.yogamovement.com/) for the past 3 years. At the beginning of 2020, they had a pretty good deal so I happily signed up for 30+5 class package that cost me $550 (which worked out to be $15.7 per class. yay). Now I have 35 classes on top of 20 left-over classes from my previous package. I'm very determined to use them before expiry date.

*Yoga With Adrienne motivates me:*
If I want to do 4 times a week, having a package with 60+ classes is not enough. I still need to practice at home. I fall in love with [Yoga with Adrienne channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene). It's easy to follow. Adrienne is like the goddess of yoga community in Youtube. Her chatty nature, ground to earth, sympathy really make me feel like I'm practising with a friend at my home.

*Good mat, comfortable clothes motivate me:*
Yoga requires minimal equipment: mat and some comfortable clothes. I bought a good mat ($60) from Decathlon and leveled up my yoga outfit (I mainly used my home clothes before). With a good mat and comfortable clothes, I can focus more on yoga itself, instead of getting distracted because I feel itchy or my clothes get in my breathing flow.

#### My schedule
My ideal 4 times a week schedule looks like this:
1. Wednesday morning 7am - 8am at Yoga Movement: I have to wake up at 5.45am to get ready for this. It wasn't easy, or tough to be exact. Sometimes, I have to skip this option. I choose Wednesday because that's my hair wash day and I usually shower after I do yoga.
2. Saturday morning 8am - 9am at Yoga Movement (or any other class): For this one, I usually try a more challenging class like Power or Hot Basic since I'm quite comfortable with Basic.
3. Sunday morning at home or with my friends in Marina Bay Sand
4. Sunday afternoon at home during my hair care routine (read hair mask with coconut oil)

Sounds pretty good so far. I hope to see myself going for more challenging classes, keeping up with the schedule and being comfortable waking up early.
