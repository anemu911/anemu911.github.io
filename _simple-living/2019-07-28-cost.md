### Motivation

I’m exploring `Simple Living` lifestyle. I'm trying to be more eco-friendly by producing less trash. Recycling is not an optimal option for me as I don’t have enough knowledge and time to efficiently recycle. I don't believe I need to go all out, at the cost of convenience and weird routines to achieve simple living. Natural products are cool but sometimes, it's better to use commercial products if they are what I need.

Now the question here is: How much does `Simple Living` cost? How does it compare with other options?
Below is what I have consumed so far and will update the list frequently to get the answer.

### Body / Face / Hair

| Essential oil      |2-3 times/week |15        | 30ml |DIY mat spray |

### Things that don't work out for me

Sometimes, certain `natural items` just don't work out because (1) I don't know how to use it, (2) The item doesn't fit into my routine, (3) It's just a bad product

|Item                | Cost (SGD)|Amount| Purpose   | Reason for stop using |
|--------------------|:---------:|:----:|:---------:|----------------------:|
| Natural loofah     | 3         | 1    |Shower     | Hygiene issue. After a while, it turns dirty |
| Straw              | Free gift | 2    |Drinking   | Hygiene issue. If drinking on the street. I don't know where to `store dirty straws` |
| Tumbler            | 13        | 250ml|Drinking   | Spilling issue    |
| DIY toothpaste     | 9         | 30ml |Toothpaste | Ingredients contain coconut oil so it always melts while brushing|

### Other aspects that I haven't simplified yet
#### On the go:
When I'm on the go, I strive to bring `light` and `simple stuff`. I have little choice but to go for plastic / not eco-friendly options. These are few things I wish to find a creative way to optimise:
- Plastic cup when outside (e.g. drinking tea, coffee or bubble tea). Tumbler gave me spilling issues and storing `dirty stuff` after usage
- Tissues. Bringing cloth is fine but the problem is where to keep dirty tissues in my bag.

#### Tissue
I use tissue to wipe my table (when I don't have the table cloth), to wipe my mouth (when I don't have access to water), etc. Only tissue is there and it's super convenient. Unfortunately, tissue is non-recyclable because it's contaminated with other non-recycle content

#### Food
- Food waste: I cook once or twice a week. If I don't plan properly, I would easily end up with left over ingredients that can't be used till next week. Here's an [attempt](http://localhost:4000/projects/matching-recipes)
- Cling wrap: I'm researching this an [alternative](https://www.amazon.com/ORIGINAL-PATENTED-SILICONE-STRETCH-COVERS/dp/B00FCFJIDS)
