I'm Hanh. This blog is written by me and sometimes, contributed by my friends.

### The existence of Han(h)book
I have been writing articles as a way of reflection, because there is no way I can keep all those thoughts in my brain. I keep quite a number of articles in my private blog because I always feel hesitant in leaving my writing trace in a public platform (i.e personal blog). Because there's no clear reason why I should feel feel scared, this blog is an attempt to overcome that feeling.

### About this blog
This blog covers my steps to essentialism, my personal projects and my learnings from working as a software product manager.
