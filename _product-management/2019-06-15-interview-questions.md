### Motivation
I have had several opportunities to attend interviews as a candidate and received very interesting questions / experiences. This article is to document the questions I was asked in those interviews. Also, it was fun to look back once in a while.

### Background
I've been working under the title "Product Manager" (mainly with e-commerce and logistics products) for a while. Each PM job exposes me to a different variation of PM. Overtime, I become more selective of what variations I like. With this knowledge, interviewing becomes more fun as I try to decipher what PM variations the company practices.

### General questions
_Usually asked during HR round and/or get-to-know section_
1. What do you like about Product Management?
2. What skills do you think a PM should have?
3. Share a failed project and/or a successful project that you were involved
4. Tell me some projects that you did in your previous companies
5. Why are you looking out for opportunities?
6. What is your product cycle (How do you run a product end-to-end)? This usually includes prioritisation, expectation management, managing development, roll out and results monitoring.
7. What is your thought process in prioritising issues?

Now, the company's plan is to expand to multiple markets quickly. For each market, they need to collaborate with a logistic partner and inventory partner to handle operations. With those context in mind, what do you think should be the overview technical architecture?
2. Logic question:Let’s say you work for a ride-hailing company. And you find that there’s an issue with ETA (driver) accuracy. What can contribute to the root cause? What are the metric you look at?
