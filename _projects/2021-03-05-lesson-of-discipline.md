### Background
I'm obsessed with planning. I plan for my weekly meals, create my to-do list or set up my self-learn Korean calendar. It always gives me the hint of accomplishment even before I start doing anything. However, recently, when I look at my plan for self-learn Korean,  I realise how lack of discipline I am.

My goal for the year is to able to watch some Youtube videos in Korean with subtitles. With that, I want to spend 1 hour of Korean every 1-2 days. Let's see how it turns out.

### My January calendar

New year new hope. I started the year strong with consistent Korean sessions. At first, I even psychoed myself by having lesson every day but I realised that it's not doable. Still it looks pretty legit.

### My February calendar

Somehow reality decides to come this month. I found myself trapped in excuses like (1) low energy in the evening, (2) do not want to use screen after work, (3) eyes are tired blah blah blah. My discipline went down to drain. I usually plan out lessons few weeks in advance. Then on the day I study, I check in the calendar and see what I'm supposed to study. That was when I realised I missed my sessions previous few days so I had to make up for it. I'm not sure why such incident happens. If I already have a reasonable plan, I should be able to follow it. Are there so many external factors that I should've considered in this plan?

### What to do from here

This is just to note down this incident, better be aware of it earlier than later. As much as I complain about my discipline, I trust the progress. I know I will get there.
