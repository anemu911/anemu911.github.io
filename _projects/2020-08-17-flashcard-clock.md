### Introduction
This Chrome extension allows users to add new word and its translated word from https://translate.google.com.

![Add word to Flashcard collection](/images/projects/flashcard-clock-add-word.jpg)

The word and its translated version will then be added to your Flashcard collection. While you browse internet, a random word from the collection will show to you to help you remember the word better.
