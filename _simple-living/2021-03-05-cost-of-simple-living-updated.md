### Background

[Cost of Simple Living](/simpe-living/cost) was my first blog post dated back in 2019. There, I listed products that I used frequently at that time. 1.5 years later, when I look at the list again, I see myself grow. I simplify my routines and adopt new low-waste options. Below are the updates.

### Hair

|Item                | Cost (SGD)    |Waste level     | Notes     |
|--------------------|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
|[Diane Moist Shampoo](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/product/moist-diane-botanical-shampoo-moist-480ml-13093749) | $18.5 for 300ml | High | One bottle lasted me for 6 months. Hands down the best shampoo I have ever used for my fragile hair. The price tag is so worth it.     |
|DIY hair tonic (Water and few drops of grapefruit essential oil ) | $12 for the essential oil | Low | This helps stimulate hair growth.|
|[Solid Conditioner](https://oasis-skin.com/collections/solid-conditioner)  | $10  |Zero        |I rarely used conditioner last time but I wanted to give this solid version a try. So far, it's a bit hard to use lol. Otherwise, this conditioner can last for at least half a year.  |
|[Bee Choo Hair Ladies hair treatment](https://www.beechooladies.com.sg/)    | $47/treatment | Low | It's a once a month hair treatment that uses natural ingredients and deep cleans my hair        |


### Body

|Item                | Cost (SGD)    |Waste level     | Notes     |
|--------------------|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
|[Menstrual cup](https://www.freedomcups.org/) | $33 | Zero |I recently switched to a new one that keeps the hold much better |
|[Soap](https://sg.scoopwholefoods.com/products/washroom) | $6 | Zero |I have ditched shower gel long ago. My skin is not super sensitive so I just want to optimise for less waste instead of special treatment |

### Face

|Item                | Cost (SGD)    |Waste level     | Notes     |
|--------------------|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
|[Jojoba oil](https://sg.iherb.com/pr/Now-Foods-Solutions-Jojoba-Oil-4-fl-oz-118-ml/901) | $16 for 118ml | Low | IA 60ml bottle can last me a good 6 months. I also extend its usage to oil cleansing on top of normal moisturiser. How wonderful! But I only use once a day now. At night, I want to use proper moisturiser that has higher hydration. |
|[Rose hip oil](https://shopee.sg/Aromatica-Organic-Rose-Hip-Oil-(30ml)-i.199380423.5958744425) | $22 for 30ml | Low | This is still my favourite face serum. My concern: Though the glass bottle can be reusable, I don't know what to do with it. |
|[Solid face cleanser](https://oasis-skin.com/collections/face/products/organic-spice-facial-bar) | $10 | Zero | This is my new found treasure. So far so good. Based on the usage, I think it last me at least 4 months. |
|[Face cleanser](https://shopee.sg/-COSRX-Good-Morning-Gel-Cleanser-Salicylic-Acid-Daily-Gentle-Cleanser-AC-Foam-Cleanser-i.172185419.2746644050) | $18 for 2 150ml bottles | High | I haven't used up my 2 bottles from Cosrx that I bought long ago. I use them when my face really needs a deep clean. |
|[Thayers face toner](https://shopee.sg/Thayers-Witch-Hazel-Alcohol-free-Face-Toner-i.36241107.2400617465)| $20 for 350ml | High | Though it gives wonderful moisture to my skin immediately, I find this product is redundant because I don't need immediate moisture as I usually prep my skin after shower. |
|[Sunscreen](https://shopee.sg/-Made-in-korea-Rovectin-Skin-Essentials-Double-Tone-Up-UV-Protector-50ml-SPF50-PA-sunscreen-sunblock-suncare-whitening-wrinkle-care-mineral-filter-makeup-base-i.287806566.3263159559) | $15 for 100ml | High | I don't think I have found a low-waste/natural alternative. Till then, I will continue using this. |


### Breakfast

|Item                | Cost (SGD)    |Waste level     | Notes     |
|--------------------|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
|Smoothie (Avocado + Mango + Seeds + Home-made oat milk) | $3/ smoothie | Low | This is my ultimate favourite. This smoothie hits 4 points at the same time: (1) Nutritious, (2) Cost-effective, (3) Fast, (4) Low-waste. All ingredients are either bought as whole fruit with minimal packaging or home-made. |

### Lunch / Dinner

|Item                | Cost (SGD)    |Waste level     | Notes     |
|--------------------|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
|Meal prep | $4–5/ meal/ person (including fruit) | Low | I never like cooking though I find myself excited eating something good made by me. I also try to restrain from delivery food as it's much more expensive, not as nutritious and makes my house as plastic containers dump. Meal prep allows me to eat healthy, simple and good food (based on my low standard) though it does take a bit of time to prepare. I usually try to prepare for 4–5 meals a week. |
|Tote bags for grocery shopping | $0 | Zero | With the exception of 1 bag, the rest were given to me as gifts. I diligently bring them along whenever I go grocery shopping or I know I'm gonna buy something. |
|Lock&Lock containers | $15/ container | Low | I use them frequently to store cooked food throughout the week. |

### Exercise

|Item                | Cost (SGD)    |Waste level     | Notes     |
|--------------------|:-------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
|[Yoga mat](https://minisosingapore.com/products/6mm-comfortable-yoga-mat) | $12 | Low | I bought a new mat to replace the super old mat from Watson I bought 4 years ago. This mat should last me at least for another 4 years. |
|[Yoga class](https://www.yogamovement.com/) | $12–$15/ class | Zero | I usually go to Yoga Movement 1–2 times a week. |
|Exercise videos in Youtube ([Yoga with Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene) and [Chloe Ting](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChloesAddiction)) | $0 | Zero | Great content and free. I love them. |
|[Exercise clothes](https://anyaactive.com/) | $30-$30/ piece | High | Since I ramped up my exercise frequently, I went on a shopping spree to get some comfortable clothes. I think I bought 8 pieces so far (over months). I think I should stop here. |


### Things that I ditched and am going to ditch soon

|Item                | Reason    |
|--------------------|:-------------:|
|Oatmeal as face cleanser     |Messy and not clean |
|Aztec Bentonite Clay     |Messy and blocking drainage |
|Face cleansers (soon)     |Have better alternative |
|Thayers facial toner (soon)     |Redundant |

### Things I want to optimise:

|Item                | Reason    |
|--------------------|:-------------:|
|Tissue paper     |Found this [Hankybook](https://hankybook.com/) as alternative but haven't tried out yet. |
|Toothpaste     |I still use the store-bought version, not ideal but haven't found good low-waste options. |

### Sum up
To obnoxiously sum up, among 20 frequently used items, 6 of them are still in high waste level (30%). On an encouraging note, 70% are zero-waste to low-waste products/experience. Woohoo!!! Let's see how this will be different when I look back 1.5 years later, maybe.

Cost wise, without doing detailed analysis (cos it will take me another article), I think I have saved a lot of money on categories like:
- Food: Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner (vs. store bought option)
- Skincare (vs. buying tons of skin care products )
- Body (vs. buying disposable pads)
