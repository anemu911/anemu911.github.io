### Background

Recently I was introduced to Hook framework by Nir Eyal. The framework tells you "what it takes" for a habit to form, be it a habit of using an app or a personal exercise routine. There are 4 elements in this habit-forming framework: trigger (internal or external), action, reward (of the action) and reinvestment. Other habit-framing framework stops at rewards and assumes that it's enough to trigger your action next time. But Eyal includes reinvestment and emphasises that it's what makes the habit sticks . According to him, reinvestment is what "bit of work" to increase likelihood of returning.

In this article, I want to evaluate the framework against my personal habits / future habits. Is there anything else that I should do to make it "stick".

### Exercise in the morning

For me, exercise used to be a "habit" for nearly 2 months as I forced myself to go through 2 30-day  challenges. But unfortunately, it kinda stops for now.

* Trigger: I enjoy spending morning to take care of myself so naturally, it's an internal trigger. I also have my exercise schedule and workout clothes ready the night before. There are 2 things that block me: (1) Duration (40 mins of workout and 20 mins of wash-up - that's a good 1 hour gone in the morning), (2) Anxiety from upcoming work (I tend to get anxious if I know that I have to tackle difficult work later on. If I get anxious, I tend to work on the "anxious" tasks first).
* Action: Go through the drill. Usually, I don't find myself enjoying the process but I do know it's for my health. Sometimes, I'm amazed at how strong I've come to hold certain pose.
* Reward: Usually after each workout, there is no instant gratification apart from believing that I will feel better. Maybe this is missing. Maybe I can give myself a treat after each workout.
* Reinvestment: I do write exercise journal after workout (another 20 mins). I guess I do want to look back and see myself how I have bettered myself through small and consistent actions everyday.

**Next steps:** Let's try making energy balls as a treat after workout.

### Meal prep

When it comes to food, I have few criteria: (1) Healthy, (2) Moderately delicious, (3) Low waste and (4) Efficient. Hence, to me, meal prep is the only answer though I don't really enjoy cooking that much.

* Trigger: They are the criteria I mentioned above. Another internal trigger is that I don't have time to ask myself what I should eat today, and start preparing meal from scratch. If that moment comes, I  usually end up in order food delivery that results in waste - a lot of it.
* Action: 2.5–3 hours of grocery shopping and preparing. Once every week. Then on the day itself, I spend additional 10–15 mins reheating food. I also have a meal plan calendar that takes off the burden of what to eat today.
* Reward: The feeling of eating good, healthy, low-waste food warms my stomach.
* Reinvestment: Actually I don't need much reinvestment as the trigger comes naturally itself, once every week. However, recently, I decide to actively ask feedback from my co-diner, my husband so that I can improve my meal plan better.

**Next steps:** I think I'm doing OK here. Let's keep it up and explore more recipes.

### Personal project

For personal work, unlike habits, it's hard to form habit with the unknown. This personal work requires me to explore, study and implement. I guess that's the fun of it.

* Trigger: I rely on my discipline. I try to schedule 2–3 hour block in advance but the only day I can fit is weekend. I try to squeeze it in weekday before but it's hard as I'm either tired from looking at the screen all day or I get distracted very easily if I try to squeeze it during working hours. I think timing is something I have to deal with here.
* Action: Once I manage to get my mind into it, I tend to just follow my goal for that 2 hours. Sometimes, as I have to figure my way out, it takes longer than 2 hours. It can go up to 4–5 hours easily.
* Reward: Most of the time, after the hour, I tell myself I have crossed off certain tasks. And I do keep the list of tasks (high level) in notion.
* Reinvestment: Just hunger to complete a milestone makes me coming back.

**Next steps:** Let's try committing 6 hours: 3 in weekday and another 3 in weekend. For weekend, maybe Friday where I have less meetings. The catch is to figure out what I have to do prior to the 3 hour block. The 3 hour block is mainly for execution. So I need to create some time for planning prior to that, maybe Thursday.
