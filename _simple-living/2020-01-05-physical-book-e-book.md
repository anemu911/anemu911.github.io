I won't say I'm an avid reader but I do try my best to read as much as I can. It was such a shame that I didn't really take note of what I read in 2019 but below is an attempt to recall:
- Escaping the build trap by Melissa Perri (Ebook)
- The headspace guide to Mindfulness and Meditation by Andy Puddicombe (Ebook)
- Educated by Tara Westover (Ebook)
- Man's search for meaning by Viktor E. Frankl (Ebook)
- The making of manager by Julie Zhou
- Upheaval by Jared Diamond
- Bad Blood by John Carreyrou
- On China by Henry Kissinger (Half finished)
- Principles by Ray Dalio

### Context
Out of 9 books, I actually only had 4 as ebooks (Kindle). They are either light books (not so many pages) or written in the narrative form. I tend to buy heavy and analytical books in physical form.

I can't imagine myself reading Principles as an e-book because it requires me to flip back and forth throughout the book. Of course, this explanation doesn't apply to all scenarios. Sometimes, I visit a bookstore and just feel like buying so I would buy, like `The making of manager` book.

### Problem
However, the problem is once I finish a physical book, it just stays there in the bookshelf. The book, at this point, is like a statue: to show people and myself that I read.

In a mindful way, it's just lame. Realistically, I don't need this book for at least a long period of time. So I should either throw it away (read: recycle) or give it to someone else (which I don't know whom. I'm not free to keep asking people every time I finish a book) or sell it (Somehow I'm never successful in doing this). So, the book

### Experiment
To live simply, should I move all books to ebooks? Digital format is a perfect way to store books (a lot of them) without taking up physical space, yet I can still retrieve. The only thing I'm scared is it will destroy my physical reading experience (read: nice cup of tea and book). But who knows? Is it really the case or it's just me thinking too much?

So I want to do an experiment. This year, 2020 will be the year that I read all books in ebook format. For each book I read, I should be able to summarise (like the Blinkist summary) and update here.

(Unfortunately, before I decided to do this, I have 3 physical books that I haven't read yet so I would try to finish them first).

### Books in 2020
- A gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles (Physical book: gift)
- High output management by Andrew S. Grove (Physical book: self-bought)
